# Subset Selection: Real-World Applications
This project simulates selecting valid subsets from a larger set under constraints (e.g., sum = 0). Such logic is widely used in:

1) Finance: Portfolio balancing with neutral returns

2) Logistics: Cost-neutral supplier or route selection

3) Inventory: Balancing stock across locations

4) Machine Learning: Feature selection using combinatorial techniques

5) Software Testing: Randomized input generation for edge-case coverage

6) Cryptography & Research: Solving subset-sum & knapsack problems

*Real-world parallels include Amazon's product bundles, Zomato's meal planning and Google Ads keyword grouping.*
