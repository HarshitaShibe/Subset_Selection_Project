# Subset Selection: Real-World Applications
This project simulates selecting valid subsets from a larger set under constraints (e.g., sum = 0). Such logic is widely used in:

Finance: Portfolio balancing with neutral returns

Logistics: Cost-neutral supplier or route selection

Inventory: Balancing stock across locations

Machine Learning: Feature selection using combinatorial techniques

Software Testing: Randomized input generation for edge-case coverage

Cryptography & Research: Solving subset-sum & knapsack problems

*Real-world parallels include Amazon's product bundles, Zomato's meal planning, and Google Ads keyword grouping.*
